# RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) Rules

## 1. Annual Contribution Limits

| Tax Year | Annual Limit |
|----------|-------------|
| 2023     | $30,780     |
| 2024     | $31,560     |
| 2025     | $32,490     |

The annual limit is the lesser of:
- The published CRA dollar limit for that year, AND
- 18% of the customer's prior year earned income (employment income, self-employment, etc.)

Pension Adjustment (PA) from employer pension plans reduces available contribution room.

## 2. Contribution Room Calculation

### Formula
```
Available Room = Prior Year Unused Room
              + Current Year New Room (18% of prior earned income, up to annual limit)
              - Pension Adjustment (PA)
              - Past Service Pension Adjustment (PSPA)
              + Pension Adjustment Reversal (PAR) if applicable
```

### Where to Find Contribution Room
- CRA My Account (most accurate, updated after NOA processing)
- Notice of Assessment (NOA) from the prior tax year — box labelled "RRSP Deduction Limit"
- The RRSP deduction limit on the NOA is the total room available for that calendar year

### Important
- Wealthsimple tracks contributions made through Wealthsimple accounts only
- Contributions made at other institutions are NOT visible to Wealthsimple
- Customers with contributions at multiple institutions must self-track total contributions
- **Wealthsimple agents cannot confirm a customer's total RRSP room without CRA data**

---

## 3. Contribution Deadlines

- RRSP contributions for a tax year are accepted until 60 days after December 31
- For 2024 tax year: deadline is March 3, 2025
- For 2025 tax year: deadline is March 2, 2026
- Contributions made in the first 60 days of a year can be applied to either the current or prior tax year

---

## 4. Over-Contribution Rules

### Buffer Zone
- CRA allows a lifetime over-contribution buffer of $2,000
- Contributions within the $2,000 buffer: no penalty
- Contributions exceeding the $2,000 buffer: subject to 1% per month penalty tax

### Penalty Calculation
```
Monthly Penalty = 1% × (Total Contributions − RRSP Deduction Limit − $2,000)
```

### CRA Reporting Requirement
- Customers who over-contribute must file CRA Form T1-OVP (Individual Tax Return for RRSP Excess Contributions)
- T1-OVP is due 90 days after the end of the calendar year in which the over-contribution occurred
- Late filing penalty: 5% of balance owing plus 1% per month (max 12 months)

### Correcting an Over-Contribution
- Option 1: Withdraw the excess amount (withdrawal is included in income; offsetting deduction available)
- Option 2: Wait for new contribution room to open at the start of the next calendar year
- Customers should consult a tax advisor before withdrawing to avoid double taxation complications

---

## 5. Spousal RRSP

- Contributions to a spousal RRSP count against the contributor's (not the spouse's) contribution room
- Attribution rules: withdrawals from spousal RRSP within 3 years of last spousal contribution are taxed in the contributor's hands
- Spousal RRSP contributions are reported on the contributor's T1 return

---

## 6. RRSP Withdrawal Rules

- Withdrawals are included in taxable income in the year received
- Withholding tax applies at source:
  - Up to $5,000: 10% withholding
  - $5,001–$15,000: 20% withholding
  - Over $15,000: 30% withholding
- RRSP contribution room is permanently lost when funds are withdrawn (unlike TFSA)
- Exception: Home Buyers' Plan (HBP) and Lifelong Learning Plan (LLP) allow tax-free withdrawal under specific conditions

---

## 7. RRSP Maturity

- RRSP must be converted to a RRIF, annuity, or collapsed by December 31 of the year the account holder turns 71
- Failure to convert results in full RRSP balance being included in income

---

## 8. Agent Escalation Rules for RRSP Issues

| Condition                                                        | Action                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Customer at or near contribution limit (within $3,000)          | Flag for advisor review             |
| Customer appears to have exceeded limit                         | Mandatory escalation — do not advise|
| Prior-year contribution room not available                      | Escalate — cannot confirm room      |
| Customer asks for tax advice on over-contribution correction    | Mandatory escalation to tax advisor |
| Customer has contributions at multiple institutions             | Escalate — Wealthsimple data incomplete |

**Agents must never provide a definitive statement on RRSP room or over-contribution status
without confirming the customer's CRA RRSP Deduction Limit from their Notice of Assessment.**
