## 2. Contribution Room Calculation

### Formula
```
Available Room = Cumulative Limit (since eligible year)
              − Total Lifetime Contributions
              + Total Lifetime Withdrawals (re-credited January 1 of following year)
```

### Key Difference from RRSP
- TFSA withdrawals restore contribution room — but not until January 1 of the year AFTER the withdrawal
- Withdrawing and re-contributing in the same calendar year does NOT create new room and causes an over-contribution

### Where to Find Contribution Room
- CRA My Account: most accurate
- Wealthsimple tracks only contributions and withdrawals within Wealthsimple TFSA accounts
- Customers with TFSAs at multiple institutions must self-track total contributions across all accounts

---

## 3. Over-Contribution Penalty

- No $2,000 buffer — unlike RRSP, any over-contribution is immediately subject to penalty
- Penalty: 1% per month on the highest excess amount in that month
- Penalty accrues monthly until the excess is withdrawn
- CRA issues a letter (RC243-SCH-A) to over-contributors

### Common Causes of Accidental Over-Contribution
1. Withdrawing and re-contributing in the same calendar year
2. Contributions at multiple institutions not tracked collectively
3. Transfers between TFSAs not processed as direct transfers (processed as withdrawal + contribution)

### Correcting an Over-Contribution
- Withdraw the excess amount immediately to stop penalty accumulation
- Withdrawal in the current year restores room only on January 1 of next year
- Customer must still pay penalty for months the over-contribution existed
- File CRA RC243 (TFSA Return) if penalty is owed

---

## 4. TFSA Transfers vs. Withdrawals

- Direct TFSA-to-TFSA transfer (between institutions): does NOT count as a withdrawal or contribution
- Transfer must be processed as a direct transfer using CRA-approved form
- If processed as withdrawal + deposit: it counts as a new contribution and may cause over-contribution
- Wealthsimple processes incoming TFSA transfers as direct transfers when properly initiated

---

## 5. Investment Income and Growth

- All investment income earned inside a TFSA is tax-free: interest, dividends, capital gains
- Losses inside a TFSA cannot be claimed as capital losses on the T1 return
- US dividends paid into a TFSA are subject to 15% US withholding tax (not recovered, unlike RRSP)
- Non-qualified investments inside a TFSA are subject to penalty tax

---

## 6. TFSA at Death

- TFSA can be transferred to a surviving spouse or common-law partner as an "exempt contribution" (does not use their TFSA room)
- Beneficiary designation recommended; successor holder designation avoids probate for qualified spouses

## 7. Agent Escalation Rules for TFSA Issues

| Condition                                                           | Action                              |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Customer appears to have re-contributed in same year as withdrawal  | Flag — likely over-contribution     |
| Customer has TFSAs at multiple institutions                         | Escalate — room cannot be confirmed |
| Customer asks about fixing an over-contribution                     | Escalate to advisor                 |
| Customer questions penalty letter from CRA                          | Escalate to tax advisor             |

**Agents must not confirm TFSA room for customers with accounts at multiple institutions.**
